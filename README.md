# Using Godot for UI #

The Using Godot for UI repository contains the source code that accompanies the article "Using Godot for UI". It is a demonstration of how Godot can be used as the UI side of a C# project for cross-platform desktop applications.

## Repository Organization ##

The repository has branches for each of the pertinent sections of the article describing this code. Those branches are:

| Article Section | Branch |
| --- | --- |
| Setting Up | setting-up |
| Simple UI | simple-ui |
| Connecting Events | connecting-events |
| Creating the Button Scene | creating-the-button-scene |
| Creating Some Stars | creating-some-stars |
| Signaling Across Scenes | signaling-across-scenes |
| Star Window | star-window |

The source images for the article are included in the imagesources folder. These are not used in the Godot project directly, and Godot should ignore them because of the **.gdignore** file. The image assets were designed with Affinity Designer, and those source files are also available in the repository.

Here is the final outcome of the entire artcile:
